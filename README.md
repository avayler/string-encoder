This technical assessment aims to understand your technical abilities, including your skill sets and responses to specific technical problems.

**Objective - 30mins:** Using the clean solution provided, encode an input string by replacing all the characters with '(' or ')' using the following rules:

1. All input characters should be treated as case-insensitive (E.g. C = c) for this exercise.
2. For all characters which appear only once in the input replace with '('.
3. For all characters which appear more than once in the input replace with ')'.

A test project has been provided so that you can verify your solution.
